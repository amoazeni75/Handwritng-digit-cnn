<h1>Handwritten Digit Recognition</h1>

<p>In this project we will discover how
to develop a deep learning model to achieve near state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST
handwritten digit recognition task in Python using the Keras deep learning library.
The MNIST problem is a dataset developed by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Christopher
Burges for evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classification problem</p>
